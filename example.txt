The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is a framework for organizing the set
of communication protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks according to
functional criteria. The foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Internet Protocol (IP). Early versions of this
networking model were known as the Department of Defense (DoD) model because the
research and development were funded by the United States Department of Defense through
DARPA.
The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be
packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four
abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of
networking.[1][2] An implementation of the layers for a particular application forms a protocol stack.
From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data
that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing internetworking
between independent networks; the transport layer, handling host-to-host communication; and the
application layer, providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.
The technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its constituent protocols are
maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The Internet protocol suite predates the
OSI model, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.
